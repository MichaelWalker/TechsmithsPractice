# Practice Questions

The files in here contain
- some empty methods
- some comments showing what the method _should_ do.
- some tests to check that its doing it correctly.

## Your Task
1) Fill in the methods in the `ListPractice` class so that the corresponding tests pass.
2) Fill in the methods in the `TrickierThings` class so that the corresponding tests pass.

## Setup
1) `Fork` this repo so that you have a copy of it in your Github.
2) `clone` the repo so that you have a version on the your computer.
3) profit! Hopefully if you just open it in intillij everything should 'JustWork'.
4) Hopefully just click the green 'Run' arrow at the top like we normally do.
(Otherwise, right click on the `src->test->java` directory in the project viewer, and click 'Run all tests')

If that doesn't work and you are having issues, let me know! :)
